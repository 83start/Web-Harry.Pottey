            Your registered publisher name and everything about your app—name, logo, description, screenshots—must be
            unique and free of Microsoft trademarks unless (1) you’ve secured permission from Microsoft through a
            license or equivalent (though such licenses are not generally available in this context); or (2) you’re only
            using a Microsoft trademark (not including logos) to describe that your product is designed to work in
            conjunction with a Microsoft product or service and as long as your app logo and/or name:
            <ul>
                <li>does not suggest/give the impression your app is actually published by, affiliated with or endorsed
                    by Microsoft; and</li>
                <li>denotes your own unique brand so as to clearly signal to users that there is no affiliation or
                    endorsement by Microsoft.</li>
            </ul>
            In addition, Microsoft logos cannot be used as a source identifier for your app icon.
